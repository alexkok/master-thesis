The errors that were found can be separated into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Compilation errors: Errors that make the generated system unable to compile, and thus it cannot be used.
\item Overflow/underflow errors:~ ~ Errors happening because of a limit that has been reached on specific types.
\item Precision errors: ~ Errors causing an unexpected outcome value when being calculated.
% \item Division errors: ??? % Isn't this precision too?
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Compilation errors}
\pinfo{Compilation error, Squants issue}
The fact that the test suit initially was being terminated was because of a compilation error. Although one assumption was that the generated system should be able to compile, another assumption we made was that the specification was consistent. The specification we created for all the properties is consistent, as Rebel did not report any syntactic or semantic errors with the type checker. The test suit is thus able to find such compilation errors. However, there can be many more compilation errors for which we do not check, which is also out of the scope of this project. The cause of this error was actually caused by an implementation error in an open source library that the generated system used, called Squants~\cite{siteSquants2017}. To fix this, we created a Github issue\footnote{https://github.com/typelevel/squants/issues/281} describing the problem. So that this can be fixed in the next release of the library.

\subsection*{Overflow/underflow errors}
\pinfo{Overflow/underflow errors, discussion and unclear definition}
The overflow/underflow errors are caused because of the use of the \textit{Integer} type. On one hand this could be prevented by checking the operations beforehand for overflow errors. On the other hand, this could be the expected behavior when an \textit{Integer} is being used in Rebel. As \textit{Integers} are known have such limits that are also dependent on the platform the application is run \todo{SOURCE}. However, in Rebel there is currently no other type that can be used to hold a bigger number. For example in Java there is \textit{Long} for a larger number, or \textit{BigDecimal} for even bigger numbers. This would mean that Rebel does not support big numbers, or that a custom type must be used for this. Considering that Rebel does not provide a type for bigger numbers, we think that the Integer is supposed to also hold bigger numbers. Since the specification is about banking products and it probably could happen that a big number is needed. After all we cannot know this for sure, as Rebel does not provide a specification yet of each of type in Rebel.

\subsection*{Precision errors}
\pinfo{Precision errors, Squants issue}
As we have seen, the Money precision errors both occurred when using \textit{Percentage} values as well as when using \textit{Integer} values to operate with the \textit{Money} type. Since we were able to reproduce the issue in a clean REPL environment, the problem existed in the open source library, called Squants, that was used for the \textit{Money} type. In order to solve this problem, we created an issue on Github\footnote{https://github.com/typelevel/squants/issues/265} related to the precision problems on the \textit{Money} type. A contributor responded and fixed the issue within a day, the change will be included in the next version of the library (1.4). So it is required to update this library in order to let these tests in our test suit pass.





% Advice?
% To think of: Where there some things encountered during the project, which might require attention, but haven't or won't be thoroughly tested with this approach. Or do some additions cover these?
% > Squants
%	- Some bugs, maybe there are more in there
% 	- Snapshot release unavailable for some time? (1.4.0-SNAPSHOT was not reachable, had to compile it ourselves)
